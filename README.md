Fingerprint authentication screen

For past 2 years, I have been working on some apps which use FingerprintManager intensively. Those apps had different UI requirements for fingerprint authentication flow and the reason was that the project owners wanted to have fingerprint authentication screen similar to their favorite apps.As you can see,
